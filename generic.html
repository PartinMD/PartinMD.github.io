								<p>	In case you missed the 40 pt header on the landing page, my name is Matthew Partin. Since I was a kid I have always been the "Why?" child. It wasn't enough for me to just know or do something, I wanted to know the "why" behind every action and reaction. The world of data is growing ever more daily and that means my childhood curiousity of knowing "Why?" is becoming more and more transparent. <br /><br />I won't go back to my childhood with this bio; however, there are a few points from the past 6 years I would like to highlight. After graduating high school, I started looking into potential career opportunities to get myself into. There are so many things that arouse my curiousity that I knew this would be a difficult feat. Later that year I got a job at a big box retail chain and began working my way to the top. <br /><br />Within the first couple years I was able to work my way up to Assistant Store Manager and continued to help the chain open 5 more stores and assist with the training of the new employees. Not long after the 3rd new store I was promoted to Co Manager of the store in my local city. I spent 2 years working in that position when I decided I wanted more. <br />I stepped down from Co Manager position in spring of 2021 to pursue a career in the world of big data. I had spent so long in a management position that I never had the opportunity to learn about this big world. Now that I am developing my skills in this new field I can see all my childhood curiousities being fueled. <br /><br />		No longer do I just ask "Why?" But I can even help tell others "Why" with the tools of Data Science.</p>
